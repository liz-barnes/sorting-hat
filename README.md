# Hogwart's Sorting Hat

## User experience
Have you always wondered what Hogwart's house you would be assigned to? The wait is over. Click "Let's get sorting!", enter your name and click "Reveal my house!" to find your fate.

## How magic was made
Bootstrap contributed to the elements of the site. The student name input and random house generator were placed in an object to then be placed in the student card. The student cards were made possible by Javascript for loops. Eventlisteners were used to show the form and assign students to a house.
